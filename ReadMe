Stick Blast is a prototype project that combines Match-3 and puzzle genres, inspired by the game Block Blast. In this game, you place sticks to complete rows and columns, trying to form squares and clear columns to keep the game going. If the columns are full and there’s no space left to place the stick objects in your hand, you lose the game.

I’ll be sharing the full version of the game on my Google Play account soon
